"""
API call throttle: 100–500 ms random delay between subsequent calls per tool.

A single MCP tool call often makes several Kylas API calls in a row (e.g.
fetch fields, then create). The first call in a tool run goes out
immediately; every call after it gets a small random delay, tracked per
async task via a contextvar so concurrent tool calls don't interfere with
each other's counts.
